# Uppy 2.0.0

## New modern bundle without polyfills

In Uppy 2.0.0, we've removed all built-in polyfills. If you need your app to
support older browser (such as IE 11), you should add the following polyfills to your bundle:

- [abortcontroller-polyfill](https://github.com/mo/abortcontroller-polyfill)
- [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)
- [md-gum-polyfill](https://github.com/mozdevs/mediaDevices-getUserMedia-polyfill)
- [resize-observer-polyfill](https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill)
- [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch)

If you're using a bundler, you need import them before Uppy:

```js
import 'core-js'
import 'whatwg-fetch'
import 'abortcontroller-polyfill/dist/polyfill-patch-fetch'
// Order matters: AbortController needs fetch which needs Promise (provided by core-js).

import 'md-gum-polyfill'
import ResizeObserver from 'resize-observer-polyfill'

window.ResizeObserver ??= ResizeObserver

export { default } from '@uppy/core'
export * from '@uppy/core'
```

If you're using Uppy from CDN, we now provide two bundles, one for up-to-date
browsers that do not include polyfills and use modern syntax, and one for legacy
browsers. When migrating, be mindful about which browsers you want to support:

```html
<!-- Modern browsers (recommended) -->
<script src="https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v2.0.0/uppy.min.js"></script>

<!-- Legacy browsers (IE11+) -->
<script nomodule src="https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v2.0.0/uppy.legacy.min.js"></script>
<script type="module">import"https://releases.transloadit.com/uppy/v2.0.0/uppy.min.js";</script>
```
## `Plugin` is replaced with `BasePlugin` and `UIPlugin`

`@uppy/core` provided a `Plugin` class for creating plugins. This was used for any official plugin, but also
for users who want to create their own plugin. But `Plugin` always came bundled with Preact, even if the plugin itself
didn't add any UI elements. 

As of Uppy 2.0.0, `Plugin` has been replaced with `BasePlugin` and `UIPlugin`. `BasePlugin` is the minimum you need to create a plugin
and `UIPlugin` incorporates Preact for rendering user interfaces.

## Strict TypeScript types by default

...

## Batch pre-signing URL's for AWS S3

...

## And more...

- The default export of `@uppy/core` is now the `Uppy` class, which means you always need to invoke it with the `new` keyword.
  This used to be a function which returns the `Uppy` class.

- The `.run` method on the `Uppy` instance has been removed.
  This method was already obsolute and only logged a warning.
  As of this major version it no longer exists.

- Upgraded almost all of Uppy's dependencies. This includes the migration to Preact X.
  All plugins that depend on Preact have been upgraded from `8.2.9` to the latest version `10.5.13`.

- `@uppy/informer` now supports showing multiple notifications at the same time. The notifications themselves have also been improved.

- Improved screenreader accessibility for checkboxes and the remove file button for `@uppy/dashboard`.

- Sort files and folders alphabetically in the Google Drive provider.

- Polished our code base with improved eslint rules, private field methods, and other modern JavaScript features
  that help us write more intention revealing and safe code.

- To make Uppy more inclusive for contributions, and to avoid an oppresive metaphor, we have renamed our `master` branch to `main`.
